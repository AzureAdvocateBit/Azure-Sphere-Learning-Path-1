## Why Azure Sphere

As billions of new devices are connected, organizations need to secure them to help protect data, privacy, physical safety, and infrastructure. Azure Sphere builds on decades of Microsoft experience in hardware, software, and cloud to provide a turnkey solution for IoT devices. Get defense in depth to embrace IoT innovation with confidence.

## Why you should care about IoT Security

Almost a day doesn't go by without some newsworthy IoT Security attack happening, and those are just the ones that make the news cycle. IoT security is absolutely fundamental and at the same time often absent from many conversations in the rush to get products to market.

The [The Seven Properties of Highly Secure Devices](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SevenPropertiesofHighlySecureDevices.pdf) is highly recommended to help you understand what is required to mitigate exposure to IoT security issues. This IoT Security whitepaper draws from industry and Microsoft experience.

Here's one of the most unconventional: a fish tank. Not just an ordinary fish tank, mind you, but a fairly high-tech one that featured Internet connectivity. That connection allowed the tank to be remotely monitored, automatically adjust temperature and salinity, and automate feedings.

It also allowed hackers to swipe 10 gigabytes of data from the North American casino that just installed it, according to a report from the threat intelligence experts at [Darktrace](http://www.darktrace.com/).
