# Learning Path Visual Studio with IoT Central Docs Depricated

The Visual Studio IoT Central docs have been deprecated in favour of the Visual Studio Code documentation.

The samples will still compile and build with Visual Studio and you can follow along with the Visual Studio Code docs. The only realy difference will be some of the screenshots.

To view the deprecated Visual Studio docs, head to [Recommended path for Windows users with Visual Studio 2019 and IoT Central](../deprecated/docs_visual_studio_iot_central/Lab_0_Introduction_and_Lab_Set_Up/README.md)
